# Sliding-Puzzle
A sliding puzzle, sliding block puzzle, or sliding tile puzzle is a combination puzzle that challenges a player to slide (frequently flat) pieces along certain routes (usually on a board) to establish a certain end-configuration. The pieces to be moved may consist of simple shapes, or they may be imprinted with colors, patterns, sections of a larger picture (like a jigsaw puzzle), numbers, or letters.

# Algorithm design and Efficiency
Sliding puzzle was a mandatory assignment as part of the course INF4130 - Algorithm Design and Efficiency at the University of Oslo. As part of the course, one goes through general algorithm classes such as dynamic programming, heuristic algorithms, probabilistic algorithms and more. The main focus of the course was on the efficiency of the solutions done in the mandatory assignments and understanding the theory for NP-completeness to better understand what problems can be solved within feasible time and others which are intractable.
